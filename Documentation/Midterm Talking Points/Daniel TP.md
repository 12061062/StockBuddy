Tasks Completed 
1. Jira Board Creation and Configuration
  - Set up the SCRUM board to manage backlog, sprint tasks, and workflow tracking.
2. Role-Based Authentication
  - Implemented system permissions so only authorized roles can manage their role’s functionalities.
3. Inventory Stock Level Management
  - Implemented backend logic to update inventory quantities automatically after transactions.
4. Low Stock Alert System
  - Implemented notifications when the inventory falls below a threshold.

Matching User Stories 
- “As a manager, I want role-based access so only authorized users can manage inventory and pricing.”
- “As a manager, I want inventory to automatically update when a sale is completed.”
- “As a manager, I want to receive low-stock alerts so I can reorder items in time.”
- “As a system, I want to store and manage transaction and product data so the system functions reliably.”

Lessons Learned - Product Development
- Alert systems must balance usefulness without overwhelming users with notifications.
- Inventory logic must handle edge cases such as rapid repeated checkout actions.
Lessons Learned - Scrum
- Having a properly configured Jira board improves sprint tracking and task clarity.
- Clear backlog organization improves development efficiency.

Challenges, Issues, and Resolutions
- Challenge: Stock levels were not updating correctly when checkout was triggered repeatedly.
- Resolution: Adjusted transaction logic to make sure inventory updates only occur after confirmed sales transactions.

Open Issues/Concerns
